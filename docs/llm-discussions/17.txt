User:

I have the following pipeline file for gitlab CI/CD.
I want the release_job to be run, only if the commit is a tag commit, but when I push to a branch, which is a banch commit, it still runs the release job. Help me with solving this.

Response:

To ensure that the `release_job` runs only when the commit is a tag commit, you can utilize the `rules` keyword in your GitLab CI/CD configuration. However, it's worth noting that currently, GitLab doesn't support using `$CI_COMMIT_TAG` directly within `rules` to check if it's a tag commit. But you can achieve this by utilizing a workaround.

Here's how you can modify your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

```yaml
release_job:
  tags:
    - docker-build
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - docker build -f Dockerfile -t "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE":"$CI_COMMIT_TAG" .
    - docker push "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE":"$CI_COMMIT_TAG"
  needs:
    - job: build-and-test
  rules:
    # Define rules based on the branch and whether it's a tag commit or not
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH && $CI_COMMIT_TAG'
      when: never
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH && !$CI_COMMIT_TAG'
      when: always
```

Explanation:

- The `release_job` job will run if `$CI_COMMIT_TAG` is not empty (indicating it's a tag commit) and `$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH` is not empty (to ensure it's not a branch commit). In this case, the `when: never` setting ensures that the job will never run when it's a tag commit.
- Conversely, if `$CI_COMMIT_TAG` is empty (indicating it's not a tag commit) and `$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH` is not empty, the job will run (`when: always`). This covers the scenario of a branch commit.

This setup ensures that the `release_job` runs only when it's a branch commit and not a tag commit. Adjust the logic according to your specific requirements if needed.
