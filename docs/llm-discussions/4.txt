Assistant:
The error message you're encountering indicates that the `data` DataFrame that you're attempting to scale with `MinMaxScaler` has 0 rows. This situation can occur if there is no overlap in timestamps between the `angular_velocity` and `steering` datasets after processing, leading to an empty DataFrame after merging. 

To diagnose and resolve this issue:

1. **Check for Timestamp Overlaps**: Ensure that there's actually overlap in the timestamps of both datasets. It's possible that after processing and deduplication, the timestamps no longer align.

2. **Investigate the Processed DataFrames**: Examine the contents of `angular_velocity`, `steering`, and especially `merged_data` to confirm they are not empty.

Here are some steps you can take for troubleshooting:

### Step 1: Check individual DataFrame sizes
```python
print("Angular Velocity Size:", angular_velocity.shape)
print("Steering Size:", steering.shape)
```

### Step 2: Check the Merged DataFrame Size
```python
print("Merged Data Size:", merged_data.shape)
```

If the `merged_data` DataFrame size is `(0, 2)`, it confirms that the merging process resulted in an empty DataFrame due to a lack of matching timestamps.

### Solutions

- **Adjust Timestamp Matching**: If the timestamps don't exactly match, consider if it makes sense in your context to merge based on nearest timestamp rather than an exact match. This can be done using `pd.merge_asof` if the data is sorted.
  
- **Re-inspect Timestamp Transformations**: Double-check the transformation applied to the timestamps (the division and conversion to integer). Ensure this operation does not distort the matching potential of the timestamps.

- **Broaden Data Integration Method**: If exact timestamp matching does not work for your case, consider other merging strategies that could facilitate a broader match or consider resampling your data.

Here's an illustrative approach using `merge_asof` as an example to handle non-exact timestamp merges, assuming a tolerance for merging of 1 second (you should adjust this according to your actual temporal resolution and requirements):

```python
angular_velocity.reset_index(inplace=True)
steering.reset_index(inplace=True)

# Assuming 'timestamp' is in seconds, and you have a reasonable tolerance for near matches.
# Sort by 'timestamp' is required for merge_asof
angular_velocity.sort_values('timestamp', inplace=True)
steering.sort_values('timestamp', inplace=True)

merged_data_asof = pd.merge_asof(angular_velocity, steering, on='timestamp', tolerance=1, direction='nearest')

# Check the size after using merge_asof
print("Size after merge_asof:", merged_data_asof.shape)
```

This approach can help in cases where timestamps may not align perfectly or are recorded at slightly different times, yet still represent the same event or time window.

After ensuring that `merged_data` isn't empty and contains the relevant data, you can then proceed to scale the data as intended.
