how to check that the name of  tag follows semantic versioning?

Response:

To check if the name of a Git tag follows semantic versioning (SemVer), you can use a regular expression in your GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration. Semantic versioning typically follows a pattern like `vX.Y.Z`, where `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are numbers representing the major, minor, and patch versions, respectively.

Here's how you can use a regular expression to validate a tag's name in your GitLab CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
check_tag_semver:
  stage: test
  script:
    - if [[ "$CI_COMMIT_TAG" =~ ^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$ ]]; then
        echo "Tag name '$CI_COMMIT_TAG' follows semantic versioning.";
      else
        echo "Tag name '$CI_COMMIT_TAG' does not follow semantic versioning.";
        exit 1;  # Exit with non-zero status to fail the job
      fi
```

In this example:

- The `check_tag_semver` job runs in the `test` stage.
- The script uses a conditional statement (`if`) to check if the `$CI_COMMIT_TAG` environment variable matches the regular expression `^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$`.
- The regular expression `^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$` ensures that the tag starts with a 'v' followed by three groups of digits separated by periods. This pattern corresponds to the typical format of semantic versioning tags.
- If the tag name matches the pattern, a message indicating that it follows semantic versioning is printed.
- If the tag name does not match the pattern, a message indicating that it does not follow semantic versioning is printed, and the script exits with a non-zero status (`exit 1`), causing the job to fail.

You can adjust the regular expression and the script logic according to your specific requirements for validating semantic versioning tags in your GitLab CI/CD pipelines.
