regex for semantic versioning (v1.2.12) used in gitlab CI/CD

Response:

You can use the following regular expression to match semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.2.12`) in GitLab CI/CD:

```regex
^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$
```

Explanation:
- `^`: Start of the string.
- `v`: Matches the literal character 'v'.
- `\d+`: Matches one or more digits.
- `\.`: Matches the literal period/dot character.
- `\d+`: Matches one or more digits.
- `\.`: Matches the literal period/dot character.
- `\d+`: Matches one or more digits.
- `$`: End of the string.

This regular expression ensures that the string starts with a 'v', followed by three sequences of digits separated by periods, and then ends. This pattern matches semantic versioning strings like `v1.2.12`.
