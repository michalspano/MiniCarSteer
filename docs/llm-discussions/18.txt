Response:

The error message `Permission denied` typically indicates that the shell is unable to execute the `release-cli` command due to insufficient permissions or incorrect file permissions. To fix this issue, you can try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check File Permissions:**
   Ensure that the `release-cli` executable has the correct permissions set to allow execution. You can use the `ls -l` command to view the permissions of the `release-cli` executable file. If it doesn't have the execute permission (`-x`), you can add it using the `chmod` command:
   ```
   chmod +x release-cli
   ```

2. **Verify Path to Executable:**
   Make sure that the `release-cli` executable is in a directory included in the system's `PATH` environment variable. If the `release-cli` executable is located in a custom directory, you may need to specify the full path to the executable when invoking the command.

3. **Check User Permissions:**
   Ensure that the user running the command has permission to execute the `release-cli` executable. If you're running the command in a CI/CD environment, such as GitLab CI, make sure that the user or service account executing the CI job has the necessary permissions.

4. **Use Absolute Path in CI Configuration:**
   If you're invoking the `release-cli` command in your GitLab CI configuration (`.gitlab-ci.yml`), try specifying the full absolute path to the `release-cli` executable. For example:
   ```yaml
   script:
     - /path/to/release-cli create --description "v0.0.1" --tag-name "v0.0.1"
   ```

5. **Ensure Docker Image Compatibility:**
   If you're using a Docker image in your CI pipeline, ensure that the Docker image contains the `release-cli` executable and that it's accessible within the Docker container. You may need to modify your Dockerfile to include the `release-cli` tool or use a different Docker image that includes it.

6. **Verify Dependencies:**
   Check if the `release-cli` tool has any dependencies or prerequisites that need to be installed or configured. Make sure that all necessary dependencies are met in your CI environment.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to identify and fix the `Permission denied` error when executing the `release-cli` command in your CI/CD pipeline.
