Response:

The error you're encountering indicates that the installation of the `numpy` package failed due to issues with compiling its dependencies. Specifically, it seems that there's a problem with compiling `Python.h`, which is a header file required for building Python extensions like `numpy`.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure you have the necessary development packages installed. In this case, it suggests installing `python-dev` or `python-devel`. You can typically install these packages using your system's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can use the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install python3-dev
   ```

2. Once you've installed the necessary development packages, try installing the requirements again:
   ```
   pip install --no-cache-dir --no-deps -r requirements.txt
   ```

These steps should resolve the compilation error and allow you to successfully install the `numpy` package along with other dependencies specified in your `requirements.txt` file.
