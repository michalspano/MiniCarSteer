Prompt:
Suppose you want to generate a regular expression on the following type of format:
```
group_<GROUP_NR>;INTEGER;INTEGER
```
The integers are arbitrary. GROUP_NR is at most 100.


ChatGPT:
You can use the following regular expression pattern to match strings in the specified format:

```
group_(?:[1-9]|[1-9][0-9]|100);\d+;\d+
```

Explanation:
    group_: Matches the literal string "group_".
    (?: ... ): Non-capturing group.
    [1-9]: Matches any digit from 1 to 9.
    [1-9][0-9]: Matches any two-digit number from 10 to 99.
    100: Matches the number 100.
    ;: Matches the semicolon character.
    \d+: Matches one or more digits (equivalent to [0-9]+).

This regular expression will correctly match strings in the format "group_<GROUP_NR>;INTEGER;INTEGER", where GROUP_NR is at most 100 and INTEGER represents arbitrary integers.
