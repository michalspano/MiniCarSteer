## Code of Conduct

### Collaboration

- The team members shall distribute the source code using a version control
  system, namely `git`, and `GitLab` (as the code distribution platform).
- We will make use of `Gitlab issues` to document what needs to be done to
  complete a part of the software that is to be built.
- We will plan our work around the assignment deadlines on `Canvas`, and are
  all aiming for the **grade 5**.
- We plan to have regular meetings to distribute our tasks and discuss our
  ideas.

### Information Transfer - Individual Contributions

We communicate on a regular basis via `Discord`. All of the individual
contributions will be shown on `Gitlab`. In addition, we will create merge
requests for our individual contributions and assign a group member to review
a particular merge request, hence augmenting a seamless transfer of information
among team members.

### Knowledge Transfer

We share knowledge on a regular basis via `Discord`. In our weekly meetings,
we will all share what we have worked on, what were our challenges and
solutions for them. This way, every group member learns about all aspects of
the project.

The following text has been suggested by LLM Mistral and the group has agreed to incorporate the ideas:
Each member of the team is obligated to take part of all of the meetings, to
ensure that they do not miss out on something. Furthermore, team members are
encouraged to document their work, so that other members can resume their work
easily.

### Communication Plan

The main communication platform is `Discord`. We plan to have meetings **twice**
a week, on **Tuesdays and Fridays**.

### Solving Conflicts

We will vote on conflicts via `Discord`, and majority decides.

### LLM Policy, Transparency, and Traceability

Our group **allows** the usage of LLMs in all aspects of the project. However, the usage has to be clearly documented.

That is, all discussions with the LLM (including the prompt and answer(s) from LLM) shall be documented as separate `TXT` files on `Gitlab` inside the `docs/llm-discussion` folder.
Each file is labeled `X.txt` where
`X` is a number which increases for every file. Moreover, each `TXT` file contains the following **heading** to clearly state the model (and the version) of the LLM in use of that discussion:

```txt
## LLM: <MODEL:VERSION> ##
```

The file name has to be referenced to wherever the ideas of that LLM discussion are used, in order to have **clear traceability**.
